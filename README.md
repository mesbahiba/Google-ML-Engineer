## üìô Course Structures

There are 9 Courses in this Professional Certificate Specialization as follows:

- [x] [__Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals__]

This course introduces participants to the big data capabilities of Google Cloud. Through a combination of presentations, demos, and hands-on labs, participants get an overview of Google Cloud and a detailed view of the data processing and machine learning capabilities. This course showcases the ease, flexibility, and power of big data solutions on Google Cloud.


- [x] [__How Google does Machine Learning__]

What is machine learning, and what kinds of problems can it solve? Google thinks about machine learning slightly differently -- of being about logic, rather than just data. We talk about why such a framing is useful for data scientists when thinking about building a pipeline of machine learning models. 

Then, we discuss the five phases of converting a candidate use case to be driven by machine learning, and consider why it is important the phases not be skipped. We end with a recognition of the biases that machine learning can amplify and how to recognize this.



- [X] [__Launching into Machine Learnings__ ]

Starting from a history of machine learning, we discuss why neural networks today perform so well in a variety of data science problems. We then discuss how to set up a supervised learning problem and find a good solution using gradient descent. This involves creating datasets that permit generalization; we talk about methods of doing so in a repeatable way that supports experimentation.

Course Objectives:
Identify why deep learning is currently popular
Optimize and evaluate models using loss functions and performance metrics
Mitigate common problems that arise in machine learning
Create repeatable and scalable training, evaluation, and test datasets



- [x] [__Introduction to TensorFlow__]

This course is focused on using the flexibility and ‚Äúease  of use‚Äù of TensorFlow 2.x and Keras to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.  You will learn about the TensorFlow 2.x API hierarchy and will get to know the main components of TensorFlow through hands-on exercises.  We will introduce you to working with datasets and feature columns. You will learn how to design and build a TensorFlow 2.x input data pipeline.  You will get hands-on practice loading csv data, numPy arrays, text data, and images using tf.Data.Dataset. You will also get hands-on practice creating numeric, categorical, bucketized, and hashed feature columns.

We will introduce you to the Keras Sequential API and the Keras Functional API to show you how to create deep learning models.  We‚Äôll talk about activation functions, loss, and optimization.  Our Jupyter Notebooks hands-on labs offer you the opportunity to build basic linear regression, basic logistic regression, and advanced logistic regression machine learning models.  You will learn how to train, deploy, and productionalize machine learning models at scale with Cloud AI Platform.



- [X] [__Feature Engineering__]

Want to know how you can improve the accuracy of your ML models? What about how to find which data columns make the most useful features? Welcome to Feature Engineering where we will discuss good vs bad features and how you can preprocess and transform them for optimal use in your models.


- [x] [__Art and Science of Machine Learning__]
Welcome to the Art and Science of machine learning.  This course is delivered in 6 modules. The course covers the essential skills of ML intuition, good judgment and experimentation needed to finely tune and optimize ML models for the best performance.  You will learn how to generalize your model using Regularization techniques and about the effects of hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate on  model performance.  We‚Äôll cover some of the most common model optimization algorithms and show you how to specify an optimization method in your TensorFlow code. 


- [x] [__Production Machine Learning Systems__]

In the course, we will dive into the components and best practices of a high-performing ML system in production environments. 

Prerequisites: Basic SQL, familiarity with Python and TensorFlow


- [x] [__MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) Fundamentals__]

This course introduces participants to MLOps tools and best practices for deploying, evaluating, monitoring and operating production ML systems on Google Cloud. MLOps is a discipline focused on the deployment, testing, monitoring, and automation of ML systems in production. Machine Learning Engineering professionals use tools for continuous improvement and evaluation of deployed models. They work with (or can be) Data Scientists, who develop models, to enable velocity and rigor in deploying the best performing models.

This course is primarily intended for the following participants:
Data Scientists looking to quickly go from machine learning prototype to production to deliver business impact.
Software Engineers looking to develop Machine Learning Engineering skills.
ML Engineers who want to adopt Google Cloud for their ML production projects.


- [x] [__ML Pipelines on Google Cloud__]

In this course, you will be learning from ML Engineers and Trainers who work with the state-of-the-art development of ML pipelines here at Google Cloud.  The first few modules will cover about TensorFlow Extended (or TFX), which is Google‚Äôs production machine learning platform based on TensorFlow for management of ML pipelines and metadata. You will learn about pipeline components and pipeline orchestration with TFX. You will also learn how you can automate your pipeline through continuous integration and continuous deployment, and how to manage ML metadata.

Then we will change focus to discuss how we can automate and reuse ML pipelines across multiple ML frameworks such as tensorflow, pytorch, scikit learn, and xgboost.  You will also learn how to use another tool on Google Cloud, Cloud Composer, to orchestrate your continuous training pipelines. And finally, we will go over how to use MLflow for managing the complete machine learning life cycle. 

Please take note that this is an advanced level course and to get the most out of this course, ideally you have the following prerequisites:

You have a good ML background and have been creating/deploying ML pipelines
You have completed the courses in the ML with Tensorflow on GCP specialization (or at least a few courses)
You have completed the MLOps Fundamentals course.
